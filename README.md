# gRPC To-Do App

**Containerized gRPC service deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**

This project showcases a gRPC service that has been containerized using Docker and deployed on GKE(Google Kubernetes Engine). The service provides an API for microservices to invoke backend functionality efficiently using gRPC. It utilizes Protocol Buffers for message and service definition, allowing for language-agnostic communication. 

By leveraging containerization, this project enables easy deployment and scalability of the gRPC service. GKE provides a robust and managed Kubernetes environment, ensuring high availability and easy management of the service. 

The repository contains the gRPC service implementation, Dockerfile for containerization, Kubernetes manifests for deployment, and documentation to guide users in deploying and utilizing the service.

**Features**:
- Containerized gRPC service using Docker
- Deployment on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Language-agnostic communication with Protocol Buffers
- Scalable and easily manageable backend API
